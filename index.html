          <h2>Explore New York City</h2>
          <p>
            New York City is made up of five boroughs: Queens, Manhattan,
            Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is home to
            approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted New York City
            the Statue of Liberty, which is now located on Liberty Island and is
            a popular tourist destination. Interestingly, it took 10 years to
            assemble, and it wasnâ€™t unveiled until 1886.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another must-visit destination is Times Square, famous for its
            towering buildings, Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This
            iconic spot was renamed after The New York Times moved its
            headquarters there. Before that, it was called Longacre Square. New
            York City is also renowned for its bridges, which connect the
            boroughs and facilitate transportation.
